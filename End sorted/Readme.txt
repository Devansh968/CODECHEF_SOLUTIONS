Chef considers a permutation P of {1,2,3,…,N} End Sorted if and only if P1=1 and PN=N.

Chef is given a permutation P.

In one operation Chef can choose any index i (1≤i≤N−1) and swap Pi and Pi+1. Determine the minimum number of operations required by Chef to make the permutation P End Sorted.

Note: An array P is said to be a permutation of {1,2,3,…,N} if P contains each element of {1,2,3,…,N} exactly once.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the length of the permutation P.
The second line contains N space-separated integers P1,P2,P3,…,PN, denoting the permutation P.
Output Format
For each test case, output minimum number of operations required by Chef to make the permutation P End Sorted.
